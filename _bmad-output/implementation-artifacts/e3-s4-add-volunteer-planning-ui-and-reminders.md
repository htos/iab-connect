# Story E3.S4: Add Volunteer Planning UI and Reminders

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a user,
I want Add Volunteer Planning UI and Reminders,
so that the product goal is satisfied.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Given user has the required permission and prerequisite data exists, when Add Volunteer Planning UI and Reminders, then event detail provides volunteer planning UI.
2. Given valid inputs and existing system constraints, when this story behavior is exercised, then members/volunteers can sign up where event policy allows it.
3. Given valid inputs and existing system constraints, when this story behavior is exercised, then event manager can assign and adjust volunteers.
4. Given valid inputs and existing system constraints, when this story behavior is exercised, then shift plan is exportable.
5. Given valid inputs and existing system constraints, when this story behavior is exercised, then reminder messages use existing email/notification infrastructure and consent/preference checks.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Confirm scope, existing code, and acceptance evidence (AC: all)
  - [ ] Inspect every expected file listed in Dev Notes before implementation and preserve existing behavior.
  - [ ] Record any product/provider decision that blocks implementation before changing code.
- [ ] Implement backend/application/infrastructure slice (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
  - [ ] Add or update Domain/Application commands, queries, DTOs, validators, and services using existing module patterns.
  - [ ] Add EF configuration and migration only when durable persistence changes are required.
  - [ ] Add Minimal API endpoints with explicit authorization policies and audit/security logging where sensitive.
- [ ] Implement frontend/user-facing slice (AC: relevant UI criteria)
  - [ ] Use shared components, standard page layout, orange primary actions, lucide icons where applicable, and typed API wrappers.
  - [ ] Add next-intl keys to frontend/messages/de.json and frontend/messages/en.json for all user-visible text.
  - [ ] Cover loading, empty, error, permission-denied, validation, success, and responsive states where the UI is touched.
- [ ] Add tests and manual validation evidence (AC: all)
  - [ ] Add focused backend unit/integration/API tests for business rules, authorization, persistence, and sensitive edge cases.
  - [ ] Add frontend tests for forms/rendering/permission states where UI is touched.
  - [ ] Document manual validation for browser, Keycloak, provider, event-day, MailHog, finance, accessibility, or webhook behavior as applicable.
- [ ] Update operational docs or requirement evidence when behavior changes (AC: all)

## Dev Notes

### Sprint Plan Context

- Multi-epic sprint-plan order: 13.
- Requirement(s): REQ-024.
- Epic goal: Complete event-day check-in, volunteer planning, and calendar integration without bypassing event visibility or authorization.
- This story is prepared from `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/sprint-plan.md`; do not start coding from the epic summary alone.

### Scope Boundaries

In scope:

- Add UI under `/events/[id]`.
- Reminder send can use Hangfire if scheduled.

Out of scope:

- Changing volunteer domain model unless E3-S3 gaps require it

### Existing Code To Inspect Before Editing

- event detail volunteer tab/route
- typed volunteer API wrapper
- Hangfire reminder job if scheduled reminder scope is accepted
- export action

Additional module context:

- backend/src/IabConnect.Domain/Events
- backend/src/IabConnect.Application/Events
- backend/src/IabConnect.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/EventRepository.cs
- backend/src/IabConnect.Infrastructure/Persistence/Repositories/EventRegistrationRepository.cs
- backend/src/IabConnect.Api/Endpoints/EventEndpoints.cs
- backend/src/IabConnect.Api/Endpoints/EventRegistrationEndpoints.cs
- frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/events
- frontend/src/app/public/events
- frontend/src/lib/services/events.ts

### Architecture Guardrails

- Keep the modular monolith and Clean Architecture boundaries: Domain for business rules, Application for commands/queries/validators, Infrastructure for EF/Keycloak/provider implementations, API for Minimal API endpoints.
- Backend authorization policies are mandatory for protected operations. Frontend role checks are UX only and never the security boundary.
- Use MediatR commands/queries and FluentValidation for workflow behavior. Keep endpoints thin and pass CancellationToken through async calls.
- EF Core schema changes require migrations under backend/src/IabConnect.Infrastructure/Migrations; do not make manual database changes.
- Frontend UI must use Next.js App Router patterns, shared UI components, next-intl keys, orange primary actions, and the standard authenticated page layout.
- Sensitive changes must preserve audit, privacy, retention, and finance compliance rules where applicable.

Story-specific risks:

- Event visibility and staff/admin authorization must gate roster, export, scanner, volunteer, and private calendar output.
- QR/manual check-in state changes must be idempotent and auditable.
- Offline exports and calendar feeds can expose personal or private event data; limit fields and visibility.

### Implementation Guidance

- Prefer extending existing module patterns over creating new parallel services, routes, or UI primitives.
- Keep request/response DTOs explicit at API/Application boundaries; never expose EF entities directly to frontend or external API responses.
- Preserve current behavior for existing member, event, finance, communication, identity, and public routes unless an acceptance criterion explicitly changes it.
- Add audit/security logs for create/update/delete, revocation, merge, finance, provider, webhook, and access-denied behavior where this story touches sensitive operations.
- Keep provider-dependent behavior disabled, documented, or behind configuration until credentials, scopes, signing policy, and whitelist decisions are available.

### Testing Requirements

Required planned evidence from source story:

- Frontend tests for role-based actions.
- Manual validation for export and reminder send.

Concrete test guidance:

- Backend: xUnit v3, FluentAssertions, Moq only for external boundaries; Testcontainers PostgreSQL for repository/persistence behavior.
- API: authorization, routing, serialization, response contracts, rate/scope behavior where applicable.
- Frontend: Vitest/Testing Library for shared controls/forms/rendering/permission states; Playwright or manual browser validation for critical flows.
- Manual: capture browser, Keycloak, provider, event-day, MailHog, finance, accessibility, or webhook validation notes where automated coverage cannot prove behavior.

Minimum verification before marking implementation complete:

- Backend: run focused tests for changed handlers/services/repositories/endpoints, then `dotnet test` from `backend` when local infrastructure permits.
- Frontend: run `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and relevant Vitest/Playwright tests from `frontend` when UI changes are made.

### Previous Story Intelligence

- Build on `e3-s3-add-volunteer-planning-domain-and-api.md` if present. Reuse its module paths, endpoint conventions, test style, and review findings.

- Recent git context before this planning pass: `feat(REQ-017): Segmentierung & Verteiler - vollständige Implementierung`; reuse established member segment, audit, and communication patterns where relevant.
- `e1-s1-configure-role-based-mfa-policy.md` is already `in-progress` with a review finding requiring live Keycloak MFA validation; do not close or overwrite it from this story.

### Latest Technical Context

- Keycloak current server administration guide documents OTP, WebAuthn/passkeys, and recovery codes as 2FA options; use infra/docker-compose.yml as the implementation version source of truth. https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html
- ASP.NET Core 10 policy authorization remains the official pattern for requirement/handler based access control. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/policies?view=aspnetcore-10.0
- Next.js 16 App Router docs are the framework reference for routes, server/client components, and route handlers. https://nextjs.org/docs/app
- EF Core migrations should be generated from model changes and tracked in source control. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/managing-schemas/migrations/
- Hangfire background jobs persist work and need idempotent handlers because retries/at-least-once execution are expected. https://docs.hangfire.io/
- WCAG 2.2 is the baseline accessibility reference for labels, focus, contrast, keyboard operation, and error identification. https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag/

### Project Structure Notes

## Validation Notes

- Create-story validation completed on 2026-05-12 for `e3-s4-add-volunteer-planning-ui-and-reminders`.
- Checklist coverage: acceptance criteria, source paths, authorization/audit/privacy/finance impact, migration need, tests, manual validation, i18n/accessibility states where relevant.
- Remaining implementation risk: code-level inspection may split this story further if existing module coupling or provider decisions make the scope too large.
